Great! üéâ Now let me explain **how** it was solved and **what proxy does**, using a real-world analogy + technical breakdown:

---

## üß† The Problem in Simple Words:

Your **React app (frontend)** is running on one server:
üëâ `http://localhost:5173`

Your **Node.js/Express (backend)** is running on another server:
üëâ `http://localhost:5000`

But when you wrote this in React:

```js
axios.get('/api/problems/123')
```

‚Ä¶it **assumed** the route `/api/problems/123` is available on the same origin (`:5173`) ‚Äî which it's not. So what did it find there? Nothing. So Vite served the default page (`index.html`) instead ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what ended up in `res.data`, causing your `.map()` to crash.

## üõ°Ô∏è The Fix: Proxy

### ‚ú® What is a Proxy?

A **proxy server** in development is like a **messenger** that takes your request from the frontend and forwards it to the backend ‚Äî across different ports ‚Äî while making it **look like it's coming from the same place**.

---

## üßµ Analogy Time:

Imagine:

* You (React frontend) are in **Room 5173**.
* Your backend is in **Room 5000**.
* You yell: ‚ÄúGive me problem 123!‚Äù

If you don‚Äôt have a messenger (proxy), your yell only reaches Room 5173, and no one there knows anything about problems ‚Äî so it hands you a blank sheet (`index.html`).

But if you have a **proxy messenger**, it hears your yell and runs to Room 5000, asks for problem 123, and brings it back to you in Room 5173 like nothing ever happened. Now you're happy, and `.map()` works.

---

## üîß How Vite Proxy Works

By adding this to `vite.config.js`:

```js
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:5000', // Where your backend is
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
  },
}
```

You're telling Vite:

> ‚ÄúIf any request starts with `/api`, please **forward it to the backend** running on port 5000.‚Äù

So:

```js
axios.get('/api/problems/123')
```

gets **transparently** transformed by Vite into:

```http
http://localhost:5000/api/problems/123
```

And the response comes back to the frontend as if nothing changed. No CORS, no issues.

---

## üß© Why not use full URL instead?

You *can* use:

```js
axios.get('http://localhost:5000/api/problems/123')
```

But then:

* You need to deal with **CORS headers**.
* You can‚Äôt easily switch between dev and prod without hardcoding URLs.

Using a **proxy**:
‚úÖ avoids CORS headaches
‚úÖ lets you write cleaner code
‚úÖ works smoothly in development
